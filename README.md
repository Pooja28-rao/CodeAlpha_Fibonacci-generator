**Fibonacci Sequence Generator**

A simple Python script that generates the Fibonacci sequence up to a specified number of terms.

**About the Project**

This project is a basic implementation of the Fibonacci sequence generator. The Fibonacci sequence is a series where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones, typically starting with 0 and 1. This script allows users to input the number of terms they want and generates the sequence accordingly.

**Features**

- Accepts user input for the number of Fibonacci terms to generate.
- Handles edge cases for invalid inputs (like non-integers or negative numbers).
- Provides simple and clean output of the Fibonacci sequence.

**Technologies Used**

- Python 3.x

**Installation**

To use or contribute to this project, you can follow these steps:

1. **Clone the repository**:

   bash

   Copy code

   git clone https://github.com/username/fibonacci-sequence.git

1. **Navigate to the project directory**:

   bash

   Copy code

   cd fibonacci-sequence

1. **Run the script**: Ensure you have Python installed, then run the script from the command line:

   bash

   Copy code

   python fibonacci.py

**Usage**

Once you run the script, it will ask for the number of terms to generate in the Fibonacci sequence.

Example:

bash

Copy code

Enter the number of terms in the Fibonacci sequence: 5

Fibonacci sequence: [0, 1, 1, 2, 3]

If you enter a non-integer or a number less than 1, it will prompt you with an error message.

**Code Snippet**

python

Copy code

def fibonacci(n):

`    `fib\_sequence = [0, 1]

`    `for i in range(2, n):

`        `next\_value = fib\_sequence[-1] + fib\_sequence[-2]

`        `fib\_sequence.append(next\_value)

`    `return fib\_sequence
